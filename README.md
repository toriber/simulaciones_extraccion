# Numerical Simulations of optimal pits with optimal transport

## Personal Portafolio

The following folders have simulations of optimal pits with optimal transport [[1]](#1), by using an integer solver via __Pulp__ with __Python__. <br>
Also there is simultations with a capacity constrain that I developed in my Master thesis, for more information my contact is: <a>bernardo.recabarren@sansano.usm.cl</a>. As soon as I finish my document I'll put the link in this readme.<br>
<br>
To run the pit1.py file 
```bash  
> python pit1.py
```
and then visualize the pit with __Plotly__ in c_generator.ipynb file
